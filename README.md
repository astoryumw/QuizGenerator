# QuizGenerator
The program will read a vocabulary list .txt file into an array. It will then select a vocabulary word, the matching defintion and three other random words. It will ask the user what they think the matching word is and tell them if they're right or wrong.

TODO: make it where it cannot select the same vocabulary words in the same list, make it where the user can continue the quiz past one word and add points each time they're right.
